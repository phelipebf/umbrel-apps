description: >-
  Maybe is a fully (your finances are secure) open-source OS for your personal finances built by
  a small team alongside an incredible community.


  This is an early access release of Maybe that is only available to those who self-host.
  Maybe is under active development and is still working towards a stable release with a full feature set.
releaseNotes: >-
  ⚠️ If you previously added a Synth API key manually to the .env file, you will need to add it again after upgrading Maybe.
  You now do this via the UI by going to Settings > Self hosting.


  The first production-ready version of Maybe is here! In this release you can:
    - Add all of your accounts
    - Import accounts, transactions, and trades by CSV
    - See your net worth, total spending, and total income
    - Manage transactions (categories, tags, notes)
    - Manage investment portfolios (buys, sells, deposits, withdrawals)
